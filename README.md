## About the project
This  project  is  executed  to  build  some  residential  house  sale  price  predictive  models  and determine the most reliable model. The report will start by proposing three predictive models, estimating and selecting the best model, evaluating the models and concluding. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the population prices of residential houses in Ames, Iowa, and these prices were observed between 2006 and 2010. In brief, there are 2930 rows and 82  columns  in  the  dataset.  It  mixes  numerical  (continuous  and  discrete)  and  categorical (ordinal  and  nominal) variables  that  mainly  focus  on  the  property's  physical  attributes.  The dataset contains 20 continuous variables that relate to some area metrics of the listing, such as  the  lot  area,  living  area  and  some more room-specific  areas  (basement and  porches).  It also has 14 discrete values, generally depicting the number of items inside the property, for example,  the  number  of  bathrooms,  kitchens  and  garages.
